|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strongly Typed API                      | Yes - Workflow classes are strongly typed with generics                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | No - You are required to pass correct input and cast the output.                                                                                         |
| Activities are Public Virtual Methods   | Yes - Activities are invoked as simple methods in same class, they are declared as public virtual methods which are replaced with scheduling logic                                                                                                                         | No - Activities are different classes                                                                                                                    |
| Schedule Individual Activities          | Yes - You can apply`[Schedule]` attribute to a parameter of type `TimeSpan` or `DateTimeOffset`, and engine will schedule the activity in future.                                                                                                                          | You cannot schedule activities, you can create timer and await on it.                                                                                    |
| Waiting Workflows Stays in Memory       | No, if wait time of next activity is more than 15 seconds, workflow is suspended and it is removed from the memory.                                                                                                                                                        | Workflow stays in memory.                                                                                                                                |
| Support for Non Deterministic Workflows | Yes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | No                                                                                                                                                       |
| Activity Result Cache                   | Activity is cached as per the parameter and time of execution, you can set `uniqueParameters` to true, to avoid time of execution being part of cache key. This will allow non deterministic workflow to be executed, it will simply ignore previous scheduled activities. | Activity is cached only based on the time of execution, and if activity with different parameter is executed, it will throw non deterministic exception. |
